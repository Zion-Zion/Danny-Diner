# Danny's-Diner

## Problem Statement
Danny, fueled by his profound love for Japanese cuisine, embarked on the restaurant venture in 2021. Eager to comprehend the dynamics of his budding business, he accumulated a trove of data, seeking to gain insights into the performance of his loyalty program. Additionally, he aimed to create user-friendly data tables that would provide a snapshot of the restaurant’s pulse without the need for SQL expertise.

## The Data
Danny shared three essential datasets: sales, menu, and members, all residing within the dannys_diner schema.

- **Sales:** This dataset serves as a ledger of customer-level purchases, meticulously tracking order dates and the products that graced each order.
- **Menu:** The menu featuring product IDs, actual product names, and their corresponding prices.
- **Members:** A list of patrons who embraced Danny’s Diner’s loyalty program, each tagged with their ‘join_date.’ Notably, this dataset includes customers who are also members, categorized into Group A and Group B.

In this project, I used SQL to assist Danny in answering questions for his business. I-

- Developed a SQL query to calculate the total amount spent by each customer, providing valuable insights into customer spending behavior.
- Created a SQL query to determine the number of days each customer visited the restaurant, offering insights into customer engagement and loyalty.
- Constructed a SQL query to identify the first menu item purchased by each customer, revealing initial customer preferences and purchase patterns.
- Analyzed restaurant sales data to identify the most popular menu items and the number of times they were purchased by customers, aiding in menu optimization and business decisions.
- Successfully determined the most popular menu item for each customer by developing a SQL query that applied DENSE_RANK(), facilitating personalized menu recommendations.
- Developed SQL queries to identify menu items purchased immediately before and after customers joined the membership program, enabling tailored marketing strategies.
- Created a SQL query to calculate the total items and amount spent by members before they joined the program, providing insights into member spending and preferences.
- Applied a SQL query to calculate customer loyalty points, accounting for special promotions and 2x points on specific items.
- Developed a SQL query to calculate points earned by customers in the first week after joining the program, considering 2x points for the initial period, supporting customer engagement and reward tracking.
